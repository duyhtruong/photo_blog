Photo_Blog was created to be a website where I can post photo heavy blogs about my travels, restaurants visits, and random write-ups. The project is written in React with content retrieved from Contentful, a headless content management system (CMS).

I chose to use a headless CMS to host my posts because I wanted to fully customize the front-end using React. Contentful's basic and free option, a space for up to 5000 assets was enough for my needs. 

The single-page-app is fully routed using React Router, with state managed by Redux. The web page is styled using custom CSS.
